# Pothole Reporting System

## Project Introduction 
*(Ticket/ Issue: Maintain Notes (README.md) for Pothole Reporting System Proposal #1)*

### Overview
The Pothole Reporting System is a web-based application designed to address one of the most common infrastructure issues faced by urban and rural areas: potholes. This system empowers citizens to report potholes with precise location data and images, ensuring timely responses by relevant authorities. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application emphasizes user-friendliness, accessibility, and data-driven decision-making for efficient road maintenance.

### Key Features

**1. User-Friendly Interface**

- Intuitive design ensures ease of use for individuals of all age groups.
- Includes guided input fields for detailed reporting.
  
**2. Geolocation Tagging** (future enhancement)
- Integrates with mapping APIs to allow users to pinpoint the exact location of potholes.
- Displays reported potholes on an interactive map.
  
**3. File Upload Capability**
- Supports image uploads to validate reports and assist authorities with visual evidence.
  
**4. Dashboard for Authorities** (future enhancement)
- A clean and functional interface for municipal teams to view, sort, and prioritize pothole reports.
- Includes search and filtering options for efficient issue management.
  
**5. Prioritization Mechanism**
- Potholes are sorted by severity, frequency of reports, and geographic proximity to facilitate faster responses.

### Purpose and Objectives
The Pothole Reporting System serves two key stakeholders: the public and local authorities.

#### For Citizens:
- Enables easy reporting of road hazards.
- Encourages civic participation in public infrastructure improvement.

#### For Authorities:
- Provides actionable data for informed decision-making.
- Reduces manual efforts in issue tracking and prioritization.

### Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **HTML:** Provides the basic structure of the application.
- **CSS:** Styles the application for a modern, responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the system.
- **Mapping API:** (e.g., Google Maps API) for geolocation services (This will be used for future enhancements).


### How It Works

- **Reporting:**
Users fill out a form detailing the pothole, including its location and an optional image.

- **Visualization:**
The reported potholes are displayed on a map.

- **Management Dashboard:**
Authorities access the dashboard to view and manage reports.

### Future Enhancements

This project is designed to be scalable. Some planned improvements include:

- **Backend Integration:**
Develop a backend using Node.js or Python for report storage and analytics.
Add user authentication for enhanced security and personalization.

- **Data Analytics:**
Integrate dashboards with analytics to display trends, high-risk areas, and response times.

- **Mobile App:**
Extend functionality to a mobile application for wider accessibility.

- **Notification System:**
Notify users when their reported potholes are addressed.
