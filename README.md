# Pothole Reporting System

## Project Introduction 
*(Ticket/ Issue: Maintain Notes (README.md) for Pothole Reporting System Proposal #1)* [Ticket](https://github.com/LS-Teja/NU-pothole-reporting-system/blob/b15b7e7af4851d7c5e66dc7e0fb359698cb6c67d/Project%20Proposal%20Ticket.png)

### Overview
The Pothole Reporting System is a web-based application designed to address one of the most common infrastructure issues faced by urban and rural areas: potholes. This system empowers citizens to report potholes with precise location data and images, ensuring timely responses by relevant authorities. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application emphasizes user-friendliness, accessibility, and data-driven decision-making for efficient road maintenance.

### Key Features

**1. User-Friendly Interface**

- Intuitive design ensures ease of use for individuals of all age groups.
- Includes guided input fields for detailed reporting.
  
**2. Geolocation Tagging** (future enhancement)
- Integrates with mapping APIs to allow users to pinpoint the exact location of potholes.
- Displays reported potholes on an interactive map.
  
**3. File Upload Capability**
- Supports image uploads to validate reports and assist authorities with visual evidence.
  
**4. Dashboard for Authorities** (future enhancement)
- A clean and functional interface for municipal teams to view, sort, and prioritize pothole reports.
- Includes search and filtering options for efficient issue management.
  
**5. Prioritization Mechanism**
- Potholes are sorted by severity, frequency of reports, and geographic proximity to facilitate faster responses.

### Purpose and Objectives
The Pothole Reporting System serves two key stakeholders: the public and local authorities.

#### For Citizens:
- Enables easy reporting of road hazards.
- Encourages civic participation in public infrastructure improvement.

#### For Authorities:
- Provides actionable data for informed decision-making.
- Reduces manual efforts in issue tracking and prioritization.

### Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **HTML:** Provides the basic structure of the application.
- **CSS:** Styles the application for a modern, responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the system.
- **Mapping API:** (e.g., Google Maps API) for geolocation services (This will be used for future enhancements).


### How It Works

- **Reporting:**
Users fill out a form detailing the pothole, including its location and an optional image.

- **Visualization:**
The reported potholes are displayed on a map.

- **Management Dashboard:**
Authorities access the dashboard to view and manage reports.

### Future Enhancements

This project is designed to be scalable. Some planned improvements include:

- **Backend Integration:**
Develop a backend using Node.js or Python for report storage and analytics.
Add user authentication for enhanced security and personalization.

- **Data Analytics:**
Integrate dashboards with analytics to display trends, high-risk areas, and response times.

- **Mobile App:**
Extend functionality to a mobile application for wider accessibility.

- **Notification System:**
Notify users when their reported potholes are addressed.


## Project Planning and Design
*(Ticket/ Issue - Design prototype using Figma and update README.md file #3)* [Ticket](https://github.com/LS-Teja/NU-pothole-reporting-system/blob/b15b7e7af4851d7c5e66dc7e0fb359698cb6c67d/Design%20Ticket.PNG)

For the Pothole Reporting System project, I will employ Agile methodology with a Kanban workflow to ensure smooth execution and flexibility. This approach will allow the team to adapt to changes quickly and efficiently while maintaining focus on incremental progress.

### Using GitHub Projects
I will leverage GitHub Projects as a project management tool to create and manage tasks for the development team. Each task will be organized into columns based on its status: To Do, In Progress, In Review and Done. This ensures a transparent and organized workflow.

### Kanban Approach

1. **Backlog:** All tasks, including feature development, bug fixes, and documentation, will be added to the backlog.
2. **Sprint Planning:** Tasks will be selected for each sprint and moved to the To Do column. Each task will be broken into smaller, manageable sub-tasks to ensure steady progress.
3. **In Progress:** As developers begin working on tasks, they will move them to the In Progress column.
4. **In Review:** Tasks successfully implemented will be unit tested in this phase.
5. **Done:** Once completed and reviewed, tasks will be marked as Done and the product will be ready for deployment.

This setup ensures we stay focused on both short-term objectives and long-term goals, using an agile, iterative approach.

### Figma Wireframe and GUI Flow

To design the user interface (UI) and flow of the Pothole Reporting System, I used Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes. The wireframes consist of three frames that demonstrate the flow of interaction with the application.

1. **Start-Up Screen (Frame 1):** This initial frame includes labels, textboxes, a file upload button, and a submit button. All fields are empty, providing a clean form for the user to fill out.
2. **Filled Form (Frame 2):** In this frame, the user enters data into the textboxes and optionally uploads an image (simulating a filled-out form). The form reflects the information entered by the user, showing the values in the textboxes and the uploaded image.
3. **Submission Confirmation (Frame 3):** After the user clicks the Submit Report button, the screen is cleared (reset) and a message appears: "Your report has been submitted successfully!"
   
The frames are connected using connectors to represent the sequence of actions: from filling the form to submitting it, followed by the confirmation message.

### What have we done so far...
Now that we have completed the setup, planning, and design phases, we have laid the groundwork for implementation to begin. These initial efforts have established a solid foundation, with the following tasks successfully completed:

**Git Repository Setup:** A centralized Git repository has been initialized and configured to manage the project's source code and documentation. 
[Project Repository creation](https://github.com/LS-Teja/NU-pothole-reporting-system/blob/b15b7e7af4851d7c5e66dc7e0fb359698cb6c67d/Project%20Repository%20creation.png)

**GitHub Project Board Creation:** A project board has been established to effectively organize, prioritize, and track tasks throughout the project's lifecycle.

**Documentation Updates:** Systematic updates to the README file have been completed at each phase, reflecting key decisions and progress.

## Project Development Phase

This phase will focus on implementing the backlog, streamlined into three iterations with one task assigned to each iteration, ordered by priority. Each iteration task is documented as a GitHub issue with clear descriptions and relevant screenshots to ensure simplicity, clarity, and alignment throughout the process.
